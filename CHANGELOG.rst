Unreleased
==========

Added
-----


* Include description of the egon-data workflow in our documentation
  `#23 <https://github.com/openego/eGon-data/issues/23>`_
* There's now a wrapper around `subprocess.run` in
  `egon.data.subprocess.run`. This wrapper catches errors better and
  displays better error messages than Python's built-in function. Use
  this wrapper wenn calling other programs in Airflow tasks.

* You can now override the default database configuration by putting a
  "local-database.yaml" into the current working directory. Values read
  from this file will override the default values. You can also generate
  this file by specifying command line switches to ``egon-data``. Look
  for the switches starting with ``--database`` in ``egon-data --help``.

* Docker will not be used if there is already a service listening on the
  HOST:PORT combination configured for the database.

* OSM data import as done in open_ego
  `#1 <https://github.com/openego/eGon-data/issues/1>`_
* Verwaltungsgebiete data import (vg250) more or less done as in open_ego
  `#3 <https://github.com/openego/eGon-data/issues/3>`_
* Zensus population data import
  `#2 <https://github.com/openego/eGon-data/issues/2>`_
* Zensus data import for households, apartments and buildings
  `#91 <https://github.com/openego/eGon-data/issues/91>`_
* DemandRegio data import for annual electricity demands
  `#5 <https://github.com/openego/eGon-data/issues/5>`_
